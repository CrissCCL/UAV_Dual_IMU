If you are going to manufacture the PCB using PCBA, or if you are going to purchase the components separately, replace Capacitor_SMD:CP_Elec_4x4.5 with:

-40°C to +85°C 2.2µF 2000hrs@85°C 4mm 5.5mA@100kHz 50V 5mm ±20% SMD, D4xL5mm Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors - SMD ROHS

Note: The closest commercially available capacitor size is 4x5mm.


If you are going to manufacture the PCB using PCBA, review and adjust any components that show warnings to match the available parts list on the website.
